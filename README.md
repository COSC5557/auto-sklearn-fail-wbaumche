# Auto-sklearn Fail

The code in `fail.py` runs
[auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) on a dataset for 5
minutes. The model it finds after that time is *worse* than just using a random
forest with default hyperparameters.

Find out what's going on, why auto-sklearn's performance is so bad, and how to
fix it.
